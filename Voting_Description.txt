🗳️ Project Title: Mini Voting Application (MEAN Stack)
📘 Description:

The Mini Voting Application is a simple and interactive web app built using the MEAN stack — MongoDB, Express.js, Angular, and Node.js.
It allows users to cast votes, add new options, and view live vote counts — all in real time.
The project demonstrates full CRUD operations and seamless data flow between frontend and backend.

⚙️ Technologies Used:

MongoDB → For storing poll options and vote counts

Express.js → Handles API routes and backend logic

Angular → Frontend interface with live data updates

Node.js → Server-side runtime environment

dotenv → To manage environment variables securely

💡 Working:

When the server starts, it automatically seeds default poll options — React, Angular, and Vue — each with 0 votes.

The Angular frontend displays a welcome section showing technologies used (M, E, A, N) in a stylish dropdown.

Below that, the “Cast Your Vote” section appears where users can:

View all current poll options

Click Vote to increase the count for any option

Click ➕ Add New Option to open a form and add a new poll choice

Added options appear instantly on the same page without reload.

Every time you restart the app, all votes are reset to zero, giving a fresh voting session.

The UI is responsive, simple, and modern, with clear separation between the header, poll cards, and form sections.

🧩 Key Features:

Full CRUD functionality (Add, Read, Update)

Real-time vote updates

Auto-reset votes on restart

Responsive and interactive Angular UI

Environment-based MongoDB connection

Clean MEAN architecture without extra services
